      <p>
        The global marketplace of organics has grown rapidly over the last few
        decades and consumer demand for organic products is increasing globally,
        with approximately 80 billion Euros ($92 billion USD) spent on organic
        product s annually. A recent report from the Research Institute of
        Organic Agriculture (FiBL) and IFOAM Organics International, shows a
        14.7% increase in organic farmland from 2014 to 2015, totalling 50.9
        million hectares, with Australia having the largest amount of
        agricultural land at 22.7 million hectares. Organic food items most
        often consumed in Europe are organic baby foods followed by organic
        eggs, fruit and vegetables, then dairy products, with organic dairy
        reaching market shares of around 10 percent of overall sales in some
        European countries. In the United States, fruit and vegetables make up
        the largest areas of organic food sales, followed by dairy products. The
        reasons consumers are increasingly choosing organic over conventional
        food products are varied, including many reasons beside personal health
        and wellbeing, such as environmental concerns or animal welfare impact.
        However, the major determinants behind consumer purchase of organic
        products, is the belief that organic food is healthier or has a superior
        nutritional profile. Animals raised using organic methods are treated
        humanely and with respect. For example, chickens are free range and not
        kept in cages, and cows are not kept in feed lots. Animals are also not
        fed any growth-regulating drugs, steroids, hormones or antibiotics.
        However, the animals may be treated with vaccines to prevent disease.
        Organic farming is also concerned with protecting the environment and
        working in harmony with existing ecosystems,including conserving water,
        soil and energy, and using renewable resources and natural farming
        cycles. Traditional farming methods are often used, such as rotating
        crops to prevent nutrient depletion in soil and integrating crops and
        livestock.
