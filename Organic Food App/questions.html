                The term “organic” refers to the way agricultural products are grown and processed. 
                While the regulations vary from country to country, in the U.S., organic crops must
                be grown without the use of synthetic herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers, or 
                bioengineered genes (GMOs).
                Organic livestock raised for meat, eggs, and dairy products must be raised in living
                conditions accommodating their natural behaviors (such as the ability to graze on pasture)
                and fed organic feed and forage. They may not be given antibiotics, growth hormones, or any 
                animal by-products.

                How your food is grown or raised can have a major impact on your mental and emotional
                health as well as the environment. Organic foods often have more beneficial nutrients,
                such as antioxidants, than their conventionally-grown counterparts and people with 
                allergies to foods, chemicals, or preservatives may find their symptoms lessen or
                go away when they eat only organic foods.

                Organic food is often more expensive than conventionally-grown food. But if you set some 
                priorities, it may be possible to purchase organic food and stay within your food budget.
                Some types of conventionally-grown produce are much higher in pesticides than others,
                and should be avoided when possible. Others are low enough that buying non-organic is relatively safe.

                No, "natural" and "organic" are different. Usually, "natural" on a food label means that the 
                product has no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives. "Natural" on a label doesn't have 
                to do with the methods or materials used to grow the food ingredients.Also be careful not to 
                mix up other common food labels with organic labels. For example, certified organic beef 
                guidelines include pasture access during at least 120 days of grazing season and no growth hormones. 
                But the labels "free-range" or "hormone-free" don't mean a farmer followed all guidelines for organic certification.
